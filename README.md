### Project 1: Predicting house prices

#### Case Study:

A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car How well those variables describe the price of a car Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the Americal market

#### Objective:

To build a model of the price of cars with the available independent variables to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. This will help in making an informed decision by the automobile company

#### ML Modelling:

For this particular project linear regression model was used to predict the car prices. The metric used in this particular project is `r2_score`.

### Project 2: Telecom Churn Case Study

#### Case Study:

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

#### Objective:

To analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

#### ML Modelling:

For this particular project two models were used- Logistic Regression and Reandom Forest Classifier. The metric used for this particular project is: `confusion matrix`
